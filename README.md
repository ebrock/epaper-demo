Demo code for Waveshare epd2in13V2 epaper hat.

This is a _super_ rough demo of the Waveshare 2in13_V2 paper hat.  It prints the date in the top-left corner, "Raspberry Pi" in the center, and performs a partial update of the time.

Waveshare installation and user guide can be [found here](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_e-Paper_HAT).
